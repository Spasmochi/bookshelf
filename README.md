### A component library for free distributable experiments.

### [View Live site](https://bookshelf-theta.vercel.app/) 

This component library is pre-configured with the following integrations:

- **TypeScript** for type-safe code.
- **Styled-Components** for all the styles.
- **Tailwind** for a responsive 
- **modern-css-reset** for a reset of sensible default styles.
- **Framer Motion** for awesome animations.
- **gatsby-image and gatsby-transformer-sharp** for optimized images.
- **gatsby-plugin-manifest / SEO component** for an SEO-friendly PWA.
- **Storybook with add-ons** for showing off the awesome components.
- **Jest and React Testing library** for snapshots and unit tests.
- **ESLint with an emphasis on functional patterns (with Prettier and TypeScript integration)** to make the code look its best.
- **React Axe and React A11y for accessibility** so that the site is awesome for everyone.

## Installation

You will need to have `node` and `npm` installed on the computer.

You can either use `npx` or install the `gatsby-cli` globally.

The `npx` way:

```sh
npx gatsby new my-site https://github.com/Spasmochi/bookshelf
```

or the global way:

```sh
npm i -g gatsby-cli
gatsby new my-site https://github.com/Spasmochi/bookshelf
```

## Usage

To start the development servers:

```sh
npm run develop
```

If all was successful, you should see links to two development servers in the Node terminal. You can open these url in any browser that you would like.

1. [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080):

This is the development server that allows you to preview the website. It comes with hot-module reloading, which means that you should see the changes almost immediately without having to refresh the browser tab.

2. [http://localhost:8000/\_\_\_graphql](http://localhost:8000/___graphql):

This is the development server that allows you to interact with the the site's GraphQL data via the GraphiQL IDE.

## Styling

This library is pre-configured with [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/).

You can also apply tailwind styling via twin macro [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

```jsx
import React from "react"
import tw, { styled } from "twin.macro"
const Button = styled.button`
  ${tw`bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-800 text-white p-2 rounded`}
`
// or use the shorthand version
const Button = tw.button`
  bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-800 text-white p-2 rounded
`
const IndexPage = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Hi people</h1>
    <Button>Activate</Button>
  </div>
)
```

#### Global Styles

Global styles are defined in the `src/styles/global-styles.tsx` file using the `createGlobalStyle` function provided by styled-components. The global styles are injected in the `Layout` component via the component that is provided from the `createGlobalStyle` function.

The global style also includes the styles from [css-modern-reset](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/modern-css-reset), which aims to provide a sensible reset of browser styles.

#### Theme

You can define the theme styles in the `/src/styles/theme` file. The theme will be available in any styled-component via `props.theme` and to any other component via the `useTheme` hook.

#### Handling Media Queries

The theme utilizes the [use-media](https://github.com/streamich/use-media) library, which allows you to track the state of a CSS media queries. This works by passing a boolean for each screen size that you defined in the theme. Just define the screen sizes in `src/styles/theme`.

#### Styling Examples

**`src/pages/about.tsx` includes various examples (with comments) of using styled-components and framer-motion with the theme provider.**

#### The CSS Prop

This library is also preconfigured to work with the `css` prop:

```jsx
import styled from "styled-components";

const MyComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <h1
      css={`
        color: #333;
      `}
    >
      Hello World!
    </h1>
  </div>
);
```

_Note: The `css` prop does not play nicely with the `jsx-no-multiline-js` ESLint rule. You may want to disable the rule if you plan on using the `css` prop. This can be done in the `.eslintrc.js` file._

I personally do not use the `css` prop and prefer to define styled-components outside of the component definition. My general rule is if the component that is using a styled-component is the only component that uses it, I define the styled-component in the same file. Otherwise, I will move it out to a `components/common` directory.

```tsx
import styled from "styled-components";

const Heading = styled.h1`
  color: #333;
`;

const MyComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <Heading>Hello World!</Heading>
  </div>
);
```

## CSS Debugger

This library also includes a `CSSDebugger` component. This component allows you to easily debug the styles by drawing outlines around all elements and applying a grid in the background. It also includes a toggle button that you can optionally use during debugging.

**_Note: You can drag the toggle button around if it gets in the way._**

The `CSSDebugger` component is used in the `layout.tsx` component.

## Linting

This project includes a combination of ESLint and React-A11y rules for React and TypeScript code, which are extended from the [eslint-config-gojutin](https://github.com/gojutin/eslint-config-gojutin) npm package. Many of the rules favor a functional approach with a strong emphasis on immutability and strong type definitions.

The rules are listed as key/value pairs. The key represents the rule name and the value (number) represents the setting of the rule:

|     |       |
| --- | :---- |
| `0` | off   |
| `1` | warn  |
| `2` | error |

Here is an example of a rule:

```
"immutable/no-this": 2
```

This particular rule disallows the use of the `this` keyword, which will result in an error.

## Storybook

Storybook is available by creating stories in the `src/stories` directory and running the `npm run storybook` script. the storybook will be availble at [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006).

A chromatic integration is on the way.

You can also compile a production build of the Storybook by running `npm run build:storybook`. The compiled production build will be located in a `/storybook-static` directory.

## Deployment

Lint the files and fix all linting issues.

```sh
npm run lint
```

Run the test suite and fix any broken tests.

```sh
npm run test
```

Compile a production build to the `/public` directory.

```sh
npm run build
```

## TODOS

- Write more robust unit tests for all components and custom hook.
- Possibly add support for MDX and markdown.
- Add more Storybook add-ons with more component demos.

That's about it. Now, build something awesome ðŸ˜€
